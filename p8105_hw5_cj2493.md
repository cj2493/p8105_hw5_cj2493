Problem 1
---------

First, read in all the control arm files and experimental arm files. Then, tidy the data.

``` r
files_df = 
tibble(vec_files = list.files(path = "./data"), 
       vec_file_path = str_c("./data/", vec_files)) %>%
  mutate(observations = purrr::map(vec_file_path, read_csv)) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(vec_files, into = c("arm", "subject"), sep = "_") %>%
  separate(subject, into = c("subject", "extension"), sep = "\\.") %>%
  select(-extension, -vec_file_path) %>%
  gather(key = week, value = measurement, week_1:week_8) %>%
  separate(week, into = c("word", "week"), sep = "_") %>%
  select(-word) %>%
  mutate(subject = as.factor(subject),
         arm = as.factor(arm),
         week = as.numeric(week)) 
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
files_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = measurement, color = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm)
```
